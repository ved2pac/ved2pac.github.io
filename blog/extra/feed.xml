            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>The road to a better, smarter, and simplified file architecture for your design system.</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*qfjnfulyw-4LL7QZf0Vbtg.jpeg" /></figure><h3><strong>The Problem</strong></h3><p>One of the main concern for designers during the making of an adaptive or responsive UI is text management. The vast majority of the components built on a system are made using text elements.</p><p>The same components should be designed, adapted, and tested to live in a diversified cluster of screens and scenarios, while offering their best in terms of usability, readability, and style.</p><p>If you’d like to get rid of all the headaches that are caused by the myriad of independent, and unrelated text styles that have to be maintained on a per-project basis, Text is the right place to start.</p><h3>The Solution</h3><p>That’s all possible thanks to the power of <a href="http://figma.com">Figma’s Components</a>. Which provides designers a tool to reach a<strong> new level of abstraction</strong> by lowering the unnecessary complexity of your design system files.</p><p>Components and Overrides in Figma are so powerful that they require you to adopt a slimmer and better mindset on how you organize your work. If you follow the <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/">Atomic Design methodology</a>, Components in Figma will let you drastically reduce the amount of symbols needed to fulfill the task.</p><blockquote>If you don’t know much about Components, I strongly recommend to take a look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLRVv7JXvco&amp;index=2&amp;list=PLXDU_eVOJTx4HJKh8tQkQRtIe5YlP5smB">this series of free tutorials</a> and this <a href="https://help.figma.com/drawing/components">article</a>.</blockquote><style>body[data-twttr-rendered="true"] {background-color: transparent;}.twitter-tweet {margin: auto !important;}</style><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-align="center" data-dnt="true"><p>FigmaTip: fluid modular typography using the power of components, overrides and some scale tool wizardry.🧙‍♂️ <a href="http://twitter.com/figmadesign" target="_blank" title="Twitter profile for @figmadesign">@figmadesign</a> &quot;One root unit to rule them all.&quot; - A typography Ruler somewhere in Middle Earth. #typography #uidesign <a rel="nofollow" href="https://t.co/Tg4dxAtVfr">https://t.co/Tg4dxAtVfr</a></p><p>&#x200a;&mdash;&#x200a;<a href="https://twitter.com/MirkoSantangelo/status/961598820256768000">@MirkoSantangelo</a></p></blockquote><script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><script>function notifyResize(height) {height = height ? height : document.documentElement.offsetHeight; var resized = false; if (window.donkey && donkey.resize) {donkey.resize(height); resized = true;}if (parent && parent._resizeIframe) {var obj = {iframe: window.frameElement, height: height}; parent._resizeIframe(obj); resized = true;}if (window.location && window.location.hash === "#amp=1" && window.parent && window.parent.postMessage) {window.parent.postMessage({sentinel: "amp", type: "embed-size", height: height}, "*");}if (window.webkit && window.webkit.messageHandlers && window.webkit.messageHandlers.resize) {window.webkit.messageHandlers.resize.postMessage(height); resized = true;}return resized;}twttr.events.bind('rendered', function (event) {notifyResize();}); twttr.events.bind('resize', function (event) {notifyResize();});</script><script>if (parent && parent._resizeIframe) {var maxWidth = parseInt(window.frameElement.getAttribute("width")); if ( 500  < maxWidth) {window.frameElement.setAttribute("width", "500");}}</script><h3>Process</h3><h4><strong>Step 1: The Root Component 📟</strong></h4><p>In some aspects the technique is very similar to what <a href="https://olivermak.es/2017/02/fluid-typography/">CSS and fluid typography</a> can achieve on the web nowadays.</p><p>So let’s start by creating a new <em>Text Layer Component</em> which will act as our main <strong>Root Unit</strong>, where all other text layers are going to be linked. I picked a base of 16px / 120%.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*xxjZG095Nhd6_JKxrN2m9A.png" /><figcaption>Components generated from a Text Layer</figcaption></figure><p>Two small requirements:</p><ul><li><strong>Resize to Fit: </strong>Just make sure to not leave any empty space around the edges of the<em> Component’s Frame</em> to avoid any alignment issues on its future instances.</li></ul><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/438/1*tm77-jBym-28ROauB6Vr-g.png" /></figure><ul><li><strong>Rename:</strong> the inner text layer into “Text” so when you swap the Instances using the select menu on the Properties Panel the text content will be preserved. See <a href="https://help.figma.com/drawing/components">Swapping Nested Instances</a></li></ul><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/399/1*seD3UGlrN_lFaIehmtHiFg.png" /><figcaption>Component’s Layer Naming</figcaption></figure><h4><strong>Step 2: Setup a Modular Scale ⚖️</strong></h4><p>An effective <a href="http://webtypography.net/3.1.1">typographical system</a> is composed by interconnected elements which relates one to each other by following rules of visual proportions, contrast, and rhythm. It acts as a key element to improve consistency on our interfaces, and creates a hierarchy in which the content is laid-out.</p><p>By using a <strong>modular scale tool</strong>, like <a href="http://www.modularscale.com/">modularscale.com</a>, we can quickly generate a series of value to fed Figma’s Layers with. In our case I chose 16px as Base Unit and 1.5 as ratio (<em>So sorry Golden Ratio lovers…)</em></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/438/1*ouzoEihzDsYRfAlpvWc9dg.png" /><figcaption>Some values from modularscale.com</figcaption></figure><p>Now use those values to create some basic text layers and set the color to a bright red and finally group them. To keep things simple enough I’ve picked 4 sizes for the heading and one for the body text.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_3Zaq1M_Wlmo9hKiFi2rKw.png" /><figcaption>Set of standards text layers</figcaption></figure><h4><strong>Step 3: Generate Instances ⚙️</strong></h4><p>After that, we can generate the <em>Instances</em> starting from the <em>Root Component</em>. Just <strong>drag and drop</strong> while holding the option/alt key, then some <em>Text</em> and <em>Frame</em> adjustments as showed.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*LAIzwcoPi1K2fJHYFJsdOg.gif" /><figcaption>Generating instances from the Root Component</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Here’s the tricky part</strong>… now we need to adapt and resize the instances to match the text layers made earlier…</p><blockquote><strong>BUT…</strong>we’re not going to set the font-size via the properties panel, instead we’ll use the <a href="https://help.figma.com/editor/1322329-toolbar/scale-tool"><strong><em>Scale Tool</em></strong></a><strong> (K)</strong>.</blockquote><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/480/1*lIUAJ_Cu6PgTrL6MLj1uvA.gif" /><figcaption>Scale Tool…yeah…right!?</figcaption></figure><p>The best part about the <a href="https://help.figma.com/editor/1322329-toolbar/scale-tool"><em>Scale Tool</em></a> in Figma is its ability to <strong>scale all the properties</strong> like strokes, constrains, and sizes proportionally, while keeping the instance/layer fully editable.</p><blockquote>So…time for some scaling!</blockquote><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*BMrGucwgKpIsdDpb6wGKag.gif" /></figure><blockquote><strong>Note</strong>: If we had picked the size via the Properties panel, that would have triggered an Override and set a non-scalable behavior for the instance.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Note 2:</strong> The resulting font-size might contain some floating point values, don’t panic, it can be considered normal, especially when using this type of fluid approach. i.e. calc() generated css</blockquote><h4><strong>Step 4: Root Scaling 🤩</strong></h4><p>Just repeat Step 3 for all of your instances and you’re done!</p><p>Now since <strong>everything is connected</strong> to the <em>Root Component</em>, any change you apply — size, style, color etc — will be reflected to its instances as well.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*vuLjQ0tFXPYvmU9CS30VnA.gif" /></figure><p><strong>Important</strong>: each time you change the size of Root Component, make sure to click on <em>Resize to Fit </em>on the <em>Properties Panel</em>, as showed on Step 1 and on this snazzy gif showcasing the Outline Mode (⌘ + Y).</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*vvOS1coZ_iMIsdbWjp24Rw.gif" /></figure><h4>Step 5: Play with it 🎮</h4><p>Thanks to Figma’s components flexibility, you can completely change the styles of those instances… edit things like the font-family, line-height, vertical alignment, color, spacing, and lots more while keeping the ability to scale them dynamically from the root. In fact, changes are stored as Instance Overrides.</p><blockquote><strong>⚠️ A rule of thumb</strong>…. if you change the Instance’s font-size manually via the Properties Panel, the dynamic resize through the Root Parent will stop working for that instance.You’re basically asking Figma to set a fixed size for that text object.</blockquote><blockquote>In some occasions this behavior may comes in handy — i.e. if you need to lock the size of the body text to a value for a specific screen sizes, and keep the fluidity on the Headings only. See the“Elon Musk” label below.</blockquote><style>body[data-twttr-rendered="true"] {background-color: transparent;}.twitter-tweet {margin: auto !important;}</style><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-align="center" data-dnt="true"><p>FigmaTip: fluid modular typography using the power of components, overrides and some scale tool wizardry.🧙‍♂️ <a href="http://twitter.com/figmadesign" target="_blank" title="Twitter profile for @figmadesign">@figmadesign</a> &quot;One root unit to rule them all.&quot; - A typography Ruler somewhere in Middle Earth. #typography #uidesign <a rel="nofollow" href="https://t.co/Tg4dxAtVfr">https://t.co/Tg4dxAtVfr</a></p><p>&#x200a;&mdash;&#x200a;<a href="https://twitter.com/MirkoSantangelo/status/961598820256768000">@MirkoSantangelo</a></p></blockquote><script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><script>function notifyResize(height) {height = height ? height : document.documentElement.offsetHeight; var resized = false; if (window.donkey && donkey.resize) {donkey.resize(height); resized = true;}if (parent && parent._resizeIframe) {var obj = {iframe: window.frameElement, height: height}; parent._resizeIframe(obj); resized = true;}if (window.location && window.location.hash === "#amp=1" && window.parent && window.parent.postMessage) {window.parent.postMessage({sentinel: "amp", type: "embed-size", height: height}, "*");}if (window.webkit && window.webkit.messageHandlers && window.webkit.messageHandlers.resize) {window.webkit.messageHandlers.resize.postMessage(height); resized = true;}return resized;}twttr.events.bind('rendered', function (event) {notifyResize();}); twttr.events.bind('resize', function (event) {notifyResize();});</script><script>if (parent && parent._resizeIframe) {var maxWidth = parseInt(window.frameElement.getAttribute("width")); if ( 500  < maxWidth) {window.frameElement.setAttribute("width", "500");}}</script><h3>Wrapping it up 🌈</h3><p>This technique can be considered as the <em>tip of the Iceberg</em> of what Components in Figma are truly capable of.

As users upgrade their computers, phones, and tablets, companies like Google and Apple are increasing their security and compliance requirements.</p><p>Here are some key items you should be aware of as 2018 gets underway.</p><h4>ADA Compliance</h4><p>In 2010 the Department of Justice revised the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Standards for Accessible Design. Noticeably absent in the 279 page document were clear guidelines for making websites accessible. In the past, most websites only loosely followed the WC3 initiatives to standardize web accessibility, but with increased pressure due to private lawsuits in the US, many businesses are scrambling to update their code for adherence. It’s also the right thing to do!</p><p>Unfortunately, even the WC3 guidelines for accessibility can be mind-bending at first glance. <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/">https://www.w3.org/WAI/</a> Over the past year, we have put together a checklist that addresses common accessibility issues and are available to assist website owners looking to update their code accordingly.</p><h4>HTTPS Security</h4><p>Back in October of 2017, Google began displaying warnings when visitors using the Chrome browser reach sites (primarily those with forms) that are not loaded over HTTPS secure protocol. The warning is certainly spooky for the average user and can have a very negative impact on SEO.</p><p>In order to load a website over HTTPS, you’ll need to configure your host accordingly and obtain an SSL certificate. In addition, any third party script URLs will need to be updated to secure links. As a best practice, we have been deploying all new websites over HTTPS since 2017 and have consulted with many of our clients on securing their existing projects.</p><h4>Page Speed Insights</h4><p>Did you know Google has a tool for measuring the speed of your website based on a number of best practices they recommend?</p><p><a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/">https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/</a></p><p>Even if a site feels fast, Google may tax your website placement in search results if its algorithm determines the site to be slow.</p><p>There are a slew of recommended fixes ranging from environmental work like host upgrades and CDN to implementation to code level adjustments like Javascript loading deferment and CSS file minification.</p><p>Need help with anything listed above? Don’t hesitate to <a href="https://papertiger.formstack.com/forms/get_started">reach out</a> and we’ll work through it with you!</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=ad8c4f1d5542" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://insights.papertiger.com/new-requirements-for-2018-is-your-website-ready-ad8c4f1d5542">New Requirements for 2018: Is Your Website Ready?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://insights.papertiger.com">Paper Tiger Insights</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Steal My Idea is a column written by the team at Paper Tiger. The ideas presented in this column are up for grabs. They are yours to steal. Free. These are concepts, suggestions, and brainstorms that we would like to see in the world but have no intention of following through on.</em></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*WpKUVBydDFjKo0opKX4MDg.png" /></figure><p>I’m a hopeless Twitter addict. I like to check out my feed, read a few comments, and get blindingly angry. It isn’t Twitter that makes me angry though. It’s the users.</p><p>Lately, you may have noticed that a certain “element” has come out of the woodwork on Twitter.</p><p>Here’s a quick breakdown of what a user profile might look like.</p><ul><li>Avatar is a graphic, movie star, or historical figure.</li><li>Username is not a person’s name.</li><li>Background image is a bomb going off or something.</li><li>Bio has a bunch of #hashtags in it.</li><li>Following 800 people and has 5 followers.</li><li>Openly expresses racist beliefs.</li></ul><p>That’s right, Ma’am. Sir. The “element” I’m talking about are <strong>TROLLS</strong>.</p><p>I believe that a person should have the courage to put their name and face behind their opinions. Hiding behind a fake profile has contributed to a rapid degradation in the quality of discourse in the world.</p><p>I recently inquired with Twitter about becoming Verified, even though I am not a public figure in need of validation. My reasoning was that I am frequently called a “bot” by troll accounts that disagree with me. The concept that someone can strongly disagree with your closely-held beliefs causes such incredulity that people can’t even grasp it. You MUST be a bot or a troll if you don’t agree with me!</p><p>Twitter denied my request to be Verified since I am not a noteworthy person. Womp Womp.</p><h3>The Idea: Confirmed Profiles</h3><p>What if there was a level between troll and Verified? Not a Verified public figure, but a <strong>Confirmed</strong> person?</p><p><strong>Requirements to be confirmed:</strong></p><ul><li>Picture</li><li>Full, legal name</li><li>Address with geolocation confirmation</li><li>Phone Number with 2-Factor authentication</li><li>$25 one-time fee, payable by Credit Card (name must match).</li></ul><p>Twitter can work with a third party verification provider as well, if additional methods must be used.</p><p>Why the $25 fee? It has a couple of advantages. Aside from being a revenue source for Twitter, it also creates a barrier to entry for entities looking to create bulk profiles. $25 is just the right amount to discourage impersonation while still being affordable.</p><p>The key to success? A setting for Confirmed profiles that allows them to hide all non-verified and non-confirmed user posts. To get the maximum number of likes and retweets, you’ll need to pony up the $25 and get confirmed.</p><p>Twitter. Seriously. Steal this idea!</p><h3>Update March 9th, 2018.</h3><p><em>Twitter has they are </em><a href="https://mashable.com/2018/03/08/twitter-verification-expansion-dorsey/"><em>doing something very similar to this idea</em></a><em>.</em></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=caf03f260347" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://insights.papertiger.com/steal-my-idea-twitter-confirmed-profiles-caf03f260347">Steal My Idea: Twitter “Confirmed” Profiles</a> was originally published in <a href="https://insights.papertiger.com">Paper Tiger Insights</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*bQ-Un5HoEvfNhc6p4bL_Hw@2x.png" /></figure><p>In 2007 I was watching my career in the music industry come to a slow and anticlimactic end. For most of my adult life I had been putting out records, standing around at shows, and answering late-night calls about broken down tour vans. Just as I started to turn into the oldest guy in the concert, the universe gave me a sign to get out of the industry. The sign? Well, people completely stopping buying music and that’s what I was selling.</p><p>By 2008 the U.S. housing market had crashed and the economy followed shortly behind. I thought it was a pretty stupid time to start a new company, but thankfully my brother Jason Debiak didn’t agree. As the New Media Director at the same record label I worked at, he saw an area of opportunity opening up in the digital world. We had talked for years about starting our own digital agency and he finally felt the time was right. I didn’t require much convincing. After all, we were both experienced designers and hobby coders… so why not?</p><p>It’s now 10 years later and we have a great team, wonderful clients, and our choice of great lunch spots near the office. Here are a few of my favorite memories and milestones from the past decade.</p><ul><li>Immediately after forming our company, the iPhone was introduced and completely changed what we thought we were about to do.</li><li>We spent 6 years negotiating for the domain papertiger.com and finally secured it with the covert help of a powerful client.</li><li>We had a couple of babies. My son, Sam (2009), and Jason’s daughter Rosalie (2016). Babies are good luck if you didn’t already know.</li><li>We designed a website for a private vacation rental property in St. Croix and the whole company got to stay there and try it out. One night we ALL slept through our dinner reservations because we drank “mind erasers” after snorkling all day.</li><li>We hired two of the best developers we have ever worked with, Saad Irfan and Hidayat Sagita on the same day in 2012. Both are still with the company!</li><li>We hosted the 2012 ExpressionEngine party at SXSW and told some folks our co-worker had taken PCP the night before and fed his own face to a dog. It wasn’t true and he was at the party with us.</li><li>We tried having interns in the office but only ever had one, Michelle Perez. She’s now a Senior Designer here and a core part of the team.</li><li>We moved to an office that shares an address with a drug-testing clinic a town over. To this day, we still get patients walking in and asking to submit a sample. We made a sign that said “Not A Clinic” but a local Judge defaced it with a Sharpee marker while visiting our office building.</li><li>We found one of the greatest designers in the world, Mirko Santangelo, living in Sicily worked for a year to get him a Visa. Now he works in our office with us and we made him dress up as a wizard for Halloween.</li></ul><p>This list could go on all day. This past year, Paper Tiger has continued to grow and expand what we are capable of. The addition of Web Engineer, Taylor Daughtry, opened up a world of technical possibilities for our projects and forced us all to become better coders. We also launched a new <a href="http://papertiger.com">Portfolio</a> site and an SEO/PPC Marketplace called <a href="http://itsfirefly.com">Firefly</a>.</p><p>We look forward to 2018 and the years that follow. If you’re still reading this, thanks, Mom! I swear I will try to call you more often.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=3f4540437a3e" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://insights.papertiger.com/celebrating-10-years-of-paper-tiger-3f4540437a3e">Celebrating 10 Years of Paper Tiger</a> was originally published in <a href="https://insights.papertiger.com">Paper Tiger Insights</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>How we took the best aspects of too many files to create a pair of documents that clients can actually use</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*GU5zTRXKkOT6PdOsDyhrSg.jpeg" /></figure><p>Here at <a href="http://papertiger.com">Paper Tiger</a>, we’ve spent countless hours deciding which deliverables will work best to properly illustrate our understanding of our clients’ needs and how best to fulfill them. Early on, we kept to a traditional set of deliverables — a creative brief, a sitemap, wireframes, content outline along with 3–4 other documents that the client would have to review and approve. What we found as we grew though, was that all of these deliverables became a chore for the client (as well as for us). We needed a stronger, more concise set of deliverables that were A) easy to understand and provide feedback on and B) laser focused on the client’s key objectives.</p><p>What we’ve created are two “Frankenstein” versions of traditional deliverables — the best elements from each, reconfigured to make the most of ours (and our clients’) time:</p><ol><li><strong>Creative Outline</strong> — a combo of Creative Brief, Use Cases, Content Outline &amp; Technical Spec — this document provides our clients with a high-level look at our creative mindset, user research and plan for the new project.</li><li><strong>High-Fidelity Wireframes </strong>—<strong> </strong>rather than provide a traditional wireframe, our designers and UX team work together to create a clickable prototype that — while still boring in terms of design (grey boxes, no fonts) — lets the client provide feedback on layout, placement and pacing while also setting the stage for final design.</li></ol><h4>About the Creative Outline</h4><p>Our process relies heavily on the conversations that take place both internally and with the client. From kickoff call notes to technical documentation, we’re always referencing our research and utilizing the findings in design and development. We needed something that both client and employees could go to when they needed clarity or direction — our Creative Outline takes all of the elements from conventional deliverables and boils them down to the key parts:</p><ul><li><strong>Creative Brief</strong> — project summary, key objectives and tone</li><li><strong>Use Cases</strong> — user profiles (users and admin) and important functionality</li><li><strong>Content Outline </strong>— page heirarchy and content approximation</li><li><strong>Technical Spec </strong>— expected technology use and front-end notes</li></ul><p><strong>Discovery, Design &amp; Dev in one Document (alliteration FTW)<br></strong>We made a conscious decision to include all of the phases of a project in one document. We all wear different hats here and have our hands in different aspects of the project — for the designer at Paper Tiger, they tend to do some dev; and our developers all like to talk about design. So naturally we want everyone to have quick access to any info they may deem relevant. This holistic approach saves time and makes sure the project’s ethos is instilled throughout.</p><p><strong>A Clearer Picture of Objectives<br></strong>For our clients, aligning creative direction, user types and features &amp; functionality makes the whole process more coherent. The Creative Outline means less deliverables to review and a more focused final product.</p><h4>About the High-Fidelity Wireframes</h4><p>The next step was to provide a document that went a step further than a traditional wireframe — something that makes use of the work done with the Creative Outline, and turns it in to a document that further lays the ground work for designers and developers.</p><p><strong>From Text to Layout<br></strong>The Hi-Fi Wires convert the content outline portion of the Creative Outline to a visual format — what was a text list of elements now gets a treatment where we begin to determine location, size and functional design of each.</p><p><strong>From Layout to Prototype<br></strong>Once the flat files are created they are uploaded to our prototyping tool of choice (InvisionApp, currently) and light-up all of the buttons and navigation items.</p><p><strong>Client Feedback</strong><br>The feedback we recieve from clients on our Hi-Fi Wires gets to the point of the issue faster than traditional wires and strips out any comments about design. We can discuss expected functionality, page length, call-to-action locations, etc. right in the prototype and resolve any issues right there. It’s been a great document for clients, made that much smoother by having the Creative Outline as a jump-off point.</p><p><strong>From Approved Prototype to Fully Notated Developer Documentation<br></strong>The last thing we do to each Hi-Fi Wire is build in a complete set of notes for our devs. Any expected CMS functionality, any advanced usability notes — they all get added, reviewed, discussed and approved by the developers.</p><h4>Potential Pitfalls and How to Overcome Them</h4><p>As with anything called “non-traditional” or “Frankenstein” there are sure to be some issues that crop up — mostly having to do with fear of the unknown and pitchforks.</p><p><strong>Client understanding<br></strong>There have been a few occasions that have required us to re-explain what a deliverable “means”. Some clients have preconceptions of what something is or have gone through this process before with more traditional deliverables. We’ve found that the best way to handle this is to explain the deliverable in email that contains it, as well as provide a definition of the deliverable in the table of contents or first slide of the presentation — this way (provided they read both) they understand what it is they are reviewing. You can always point back to that definition if they have questions.</p><p><strong>Your team isn’t built this way<br></strong>We’re certainly lucky here at Paper Tiger to have a team that enjoys all of the aspects of a client project. We know though, that not all teams are built this way, and in some cases that’s deliberate. We’ve come to the conclusion that having a team that has access to and understands all aspects of your projects will never hurt, even if it may be outside of their wheelhouse.</p><h4>Wrapping up</h4><p>We know that this isn’t going to be a solution for all agencies (or even all projects at Paper Tiger) and the process of refinement will continue, so while it is a great fit for us now, we’re keenly aware that technology and client needs will continue to evolve.</p><p>That being said, going through this process has certainly helped bring clarity to projects and reduce the complexity for our clients. It’s made a once clunky, over-complicated set of information into parseable, meaningful content that will be referenced throughout the life of the project and after.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=fa15e83abdb1" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://insights.papertiger.com/creative-outlines-high-fidelity-wireframes-the-art-of-the-frankenstein-deliverable-fa15e83abdb1">Creative Outlines, High-Fidelity Wireframes &amp; the Art of the Frankenstein Deliverable</a> was originally published in <a href="https://insights.papertiger.com">Paper Tiger Insights</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>
